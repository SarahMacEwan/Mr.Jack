# Mr.Jack
Extension of the Mr. Jack game for Comp 3721, Object Oriented Design, for Milestone 4.

Responsibilities:
 - Adam:
    - Jeremy Bert
    - Sherlock Holmes
    - Madame
    - Sergeant Goodley

    - John Pizer (and associate Tile objects)
    - Joseph Lane

 - Both:
    - Spring-heeled Man
    - Expanding the board

Notes:
- For right now I just randomly divided who will implement what character, hope that's ok :D
- We need to add character classes for all the new characters, and make sure their abilities are all working
- Probably need to make the gameboard a bit larger so that a character could move up to 6 tiles
- Need to add a new type of tile (blockade) that can be placed on any regular tile to prevent motion and visibility over the blockade.
- Other bug fixes??

We have already implemented:
- Ms. Stealthy
- John Smith
- Sir William Gull
- Inspector Lestrade
