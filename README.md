# Mr.Jack
Extension of the Mr. Jack game for Comp 3721, Object Oriented Design, for Milestone 5.

##Responsibilities:
###Adam:
- Prevent Mr. Jack from escaping in the first round
  - ie make sure he is "seen" and that the seen/hidden functionality is working properly
###Sarah:
- implement a new character 
  - (probably Jeremy Bert because apparently that is a basic character listed in the assignment description??)
###Both:
- Figure out how to place characters on the board at setup

##Notes:
- idk if you want to do the seen/unseen thing or implement a new character? I'm chill either way :)
- We have already implemented:
  - Ms. Stealthy
  - John Smith
  - Sir William Gull
  - Inspector Lestrade
  - Inspector Abberline
  - Madame
